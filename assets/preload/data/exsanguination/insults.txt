Too hard? Oh sorry, I hope you didn't expect this to be easy, mortal.
You want the goop notes off? Beat me first, then we'll talk
They always say third time's the charm. In this case, it wasn't yours.
Again? I thought I taught you a lesson the first time…
You're a persistent mortal, aren't you? Let’s go again
Z: Nyeh, Again? Man, I can't believe you're still trying this K: Maybe you should go easier on them? Z: Maybe... But then that would ruin the point
You really love running face first into those goop notes, huh?
If I didn’t know any better, I'd say you like getting dissolved by me
Rest in piss or er, goop.
Ten times, yet not any closer to beating me.
